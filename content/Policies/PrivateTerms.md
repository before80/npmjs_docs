# npm Paid Services Terms - npm付费服务条款

These npm Paid Services Terms of Use (these *npm Paid Services Terms*) supplement the terms for npm Open Source offered by npm, Inc. (*npm*) at https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms (*npm Open Source Terms*). They govern access to and use of *npm Paid Services*, including but not limited to the products known as *npm Solo* and *npm Orgs*, the private package storage, delivery, organization management, and access control features of https://www.npmjs.com (the *Website*) and the npm public registry at https://registry.npmjs.org (the *Public Registry*). These are collectively called the *Paid Services*.

​	这些npm付费服务使用条款（以下简称“npm付费服务条款”）是对npm, Inc.（以下简称“npm”）在https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms（以下简称“npm开源条款”）提供的npm开源服务条款的补充。它们管理对npm付费服务的访问和使用，包括但不限于https://www.npmjs.com（以下简称“网站”）和https://registry.npmjs.org（以下简称“公共注册表”）上的*npm Solo*和*npm Orgs*等产品，以及私有软件包存储、交付、组织管理和访问控制功能。这些统称为“付费服务”。

These npm Paid Services Terms were last updated on March 10, 2022. You can review prior versions at https://github.com/npm/documentation/blob/main/content/policies/private-terms.mdx.

​	这些npm付费服务条款的最后更新日期为2022年3月10日。您可以在https://github.com/npm/documentation/blob/main/content/policies/private-terms.mdx上查看之前的版本。

You may only access or use npm Paid Services by agreeing to the npm Open Source Terms as supplemented by these npm Paid Services Terms. If npm adds any additional functionality to npm Paid Services, you must agree to these npm Paid Services Terms to use those new features, too. You add these npm Paid Services Terms to your agreement with npm by using npm Paid Services with your account (your *Account*). These npm Paid Services Terms then become a part of the contract between you and npm, until you or npm disable npm Paid Services for your Account.

​	只有同意npm开源条款并补充这些npm付费服务条款，您才能访问或使用npm付费服务。如果npm添加了任何额外的功能到npm付费服务中，您必须同意这些npm付费服务条款才能使用这些新功能。通过使用您的账户（您的“账户”）使用npm付费服务，您将这些npm付费服务条款添加到您与npm之间的协议中。然后，这些npm付费服务条款成为您和npm之间的合同的一部分，直到您或npm为您的账户禁用npm付费服务。

## 付款条款 Payment Terms

There is no charge for use of npm Open Source. If you use Paid Services, these payment terms apply. When enabling Paid Services, you must provide all the payment card details requested by the Website (your *Payment Details*). Those details must be for a valid payment card that you have the right to use (your *Payment Card*). You must keep your Payment Details up-to-date via the Website.

​	使用npm开源服务不收费。如果您使用付费服务，适用这些付款条款。在启用付费服务时，您必须提供网站要求的所有付款卡详细信息（您的“付款详细信息”）。这些详细信息必须是您有权使用的有效付款卡（您的“付款卡”）。您必须通过网站及时更新您的付款详细信息。

You can disable Paid Services at any time via the Website. npm will not refund any payment you have already made for Paid Services when you disable Paid Services.

If you agree to a Payment Plan that gives you that right, you may do so only according to that Payment Plan.
